Right now it opens every websites in websites.txt separated by new line on running "python main.py".

Will maybe add portable executable in the future.

# how to use
Make sure you have python 3 installed

Add the url you are trying to open at once in "websites.txt" file.

Make sure you are in the main.py directory.

run
``` 
python main.py
```

???

Profit.
